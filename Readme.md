In this project, you are tasked to create a program that automates searching for a word definition in a dictionary. Follow the instructions to implement




Dictionary Project is provided here: 




We should have a data source (Download from the link above)
Learn how to load json data into a python dictionary
Create a function that returns a definition of a word
Consider a condition that the entered word is not in a dictionary
Consider input from user having different cases – upper/ lower case or mixed eg: RAIN/rain/RaIN
Make your dictionary program more intelligent incase users input a word with wrong spelling the program should be able to suggest the word that might be intended.

eg . pott instead of pot or rainn instead of rain. Tip: use difflib library here


Create a Python class named Person.
The Person class should have the following attributes:
name: representing the person's name.
age: representing the person's age.
gender: representing the person's gender.
Implement a method called introduce that prints a message introducing the person with their name, age, and gender.
Create an instance of the Person class and call the introduce method to display the person's information.
Create a GitHub repository for your assignment and submit the link.
